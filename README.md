# getting-and-cleaning-course-project

The purpose of this script is to combine the test and training dataset from the UCI HAR Dataset (found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip),which contains experiment data from observing 30 test subjects wearing Samsung Galaxy S II smart phones around their waists and collecting data from the smartphones' sensors while the subjects performed different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The dataset generated by this script contains the average mean and standard deviations of each measurement across each test subject and each activity.

For more detailed descriptions of each variable, please see CodeBook.md (https://github.com/gklaus/getting-and-cleaning-course-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md).

The first step in this script is to load the dplyr and reshape packages, as functions from both packages are used in this script.

Next, we read in the txt file that contains the names of each measurement variable in the raw data (features.txt), and keep only mean and standard deviation measurements in a new character vector called keep_features.

Then, we read in the activity_labels.txt files, which matches the numerical code for each activity to it's description (e.g., 1 corresponds to "WALKING"), and then we name the column with that contains the descriptions of each activity "labels".

In the next set of steps, we read and clean the train and test sets, which contain the actual measurement data for each subject.

When reading in gacd_tidy_data.txt, use read.table and set header = TRUE so the column names read in correctly.
